## Git and Github

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes made to files over time. It provides features such as branching and merging, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.

<!-- Don't worry about these words -->
<!-- I always need to use some difficult words. That way, I can sound more professional to myself. -->

jokes aside
Git is like a time machine for your code. 
It keeps track of all the changes you make to your files, so you can go back in time and see what your code looked like at different points in time. 
It also lets multiple people work on the same code at the same time without messing things up.

## Github
GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers collaboration and code sharing capabilities, along with additional features like issue tracking, project management tools, and code review.

<!-- Here we go with the difficult words again -->

GitHub is like a big online hub for sharing and working on code. It's a website where you can store your code and collaborate with other developers. It makes it easy to share your code with others, keep track of issues and bugs, and work together to improve the code.

## Summary:

- Git helps you keep track of changes in your code over time.
- GitHub is a website that makes it easy to share and collaborate on code with others.


Think of:
Git as the tool you use on your computer to manage your code, 
GitHub as the place where you can store and share your code with others online.
